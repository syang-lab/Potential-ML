# Potential-ML
Supervised learning of temperature dependent potential energy surface from Ab initio atomic dynamics

1.Training data were collected from VO2 Ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. Designed DNN with Keras to learn the temperature dependence potential energy surface. 

2.The DNN algorithm can be applied to understand potential energy surface of different crystal structures, equilibrium and non-equilibrium state.

3.Use VO2 as an example to perform the training process
